    - Simplified American Civil War event chain [X]

         In the current system MTTHs and consciousness are used to decide when the civil war takes place.
         The key issue is that interacting with consciousness is mainly handled by consciousness events. 
         There's 22 of those events, and they all have relatively short MTTHs.
         The end result is hundreds of events being clicked away spanning ingame decades depending on chance.

         This change addresses that problem by cutting down from a total number of events from 28 into 12.
         Each one has a differing set of options that ultimately allow you to delay or shorten the MTTH for the Civil War.
         That is accomplished with the "Slavery Pressure" variable that is used to calculate the MTTH for the final events.
         There's a decision you can click to see your current Pressure value.

         1. Missouri Compromise # 1820 [X]
            # 3 months MTTH
            # Kicks off the event chain
            # Sets the 'Slavery Pressure' variable at 0

         2. The Amistad Decision #1841 [X]
            # Requires Missouri Compromise to have fired
            # 60 months MTTH / 12 months after 1841
            # Dred Scott v. Sandford can now fire
            # Opt. A +0 Pressure / Opt. B +1 Pressure / Opt. C +2 Pressure

         3. Prigg v. Pennsylvania # 1842 [X]
            # Requires The Amistad Decision to have fired
            # 12 months MTTH / 6 months after 1842
            # Opt. A +2 Pressure / Opt. B +1 Pressure

         4. Annexation of Texas # 1845 [X]
            # This event will fire after acquiring a texan core, with a MTTH of 3 months

         5. Underground Railroad # 1849 [X]
            # Requires Prigg v. Pennsylvania to have fired

            # Opt. A +1 Pressure / Opt. B +3 Pressure

         6. Compromise of 1850 # 1850 [X]
            # This event will fire after taking any combination of two states out of the below
            # New Mexico / California / Arizona / Nevada-Utah
            # Opt. A +3 Pressure / Opt. B +1 Pressure

         7. Uncle Tom's Cabin # 1852 [X]
         7a Whig Party expires [ ]
            # Requires Underground Railroad to have fired

            # Opt. A leads to the event below
            # Opt. A +2 Pressure / Opt. B +1 Pressure / Opt. C +4 Pressure

         9. Bleeding Kansas # 1855 [X]
            # Requires taking Opt. A in the event above
            # 12 months MTTH
            # Opt. A +3 Pressure

         10. Dred Scott v. Sandford # 1857 [X]
            # The MTTH of this event is calculated by the current 'Slavery Pressure' value
            # It also requires The Amistad Decision to have fired
            # 1200 months MTTH before 1840
            # 600 months MTTH between  0 and 4  pressure
            # 450 months MTTH between  5 and 7  pressure 
            # 300 months MTTH between  8 and 11 pressure
