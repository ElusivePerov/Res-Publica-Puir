/SIZED FIXED COST CBs/

 Unfortunately, the costs aren't 100% fixed for the land transfering CBs.
 Each CB in the game uses 'peace options' or po_types which have two key elements: 
  1. define the effect of the CB 
  2. define the WS cost
 The WS cost itself is defined by two separate elements: 
  1. the peace cost from the po_type
  2. the peace cost factor from the CB
 In all the practical po_types that cause land transfers the peace cost can't be altered, only the peace cost factor in the CB.
 The method used introduces a secondary po_type that is used only for it's peace cost to dilute the influence of the land transfering po_type's variable peace cost. This secondary po_type is po_gunboat which has the effect of causing the defeated to pay all their debts on peace out.
 For example this is what the equation for Acquire State Large Early looks like: 
 (po_demand_state peace cost = 10 . number of provinces in the state + number of factories in the state + level of naval base in the state + fort levels in the state) + (po_gunboat = 2000) . (peace cost factor = 0,029) = 58
 It's worth noting a few things about the equation: 
  • it assumes minimal influence from the po_demand_state peace cost variables
  • the game adds up two 0s to the peace cost
  • the peace cost factor doesn't go lower than 0,001 meaning it bottlenecks the equation as the peace cost itself is seemingly uncapped
  • great war WS reduction is applied multiplicatively at the end of the equation

 With the above in mind expect the values below to have a variance of 1 ~ 5 WS depending on factories, forts, etc.
