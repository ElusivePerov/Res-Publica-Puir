## What is Res Publica Puir

Res Publica Puir is a fork of a long line of forks from the Victoria II PUIR mod headed by me, Pero, with the invaluable support of the Victoria II modding community at large. It's purpose follows the original idea behind Puir: to focus in the multiplayer experience and improve it as much as possible.

#### And how does it achieve that?

Improvement is subjective so I can only claim to stay faithful to my own definition. Which is to keep the game competitive and dynamic by offering as many tools as possible for the players to keep themselves in check and let them define the balance of power in the game with their own hands.

Although a better answer will be in the Wiki section where I'll lay down a detailed write up of both the mod itself and Victoria II competitive multiplayer. I'll take a while to start work on this wiki though so we'll put a pin on it for now.

#### Since it's a multiplayer mod, where is it hosted?

Naturally anyone can host the mod wherever they want, but the ruleset applied in the game defines the gameplay nearly as much as the mod itself. With that said my personal recommendation is the OOS Club where I personally host the mod from time to time.
